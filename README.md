# LinkedIn News Blocker
A browser extension that hides the LinkedIn News feed on the main page.

# Why do this?
I realize that it's important to be informed on what is going on - politically, economically, and globally. However, I find that seeing headlines that make me feel a certain way (for lack of a better term) distract me from being able to focus on why I'm on LinkedIn: building connections and working on getting a job/building a career. 

This was also my way of learning how to make a browser extension, and to my surprise, this ended up being super light and easy - a total of 32 lines of code split between the actual script and a manifest file.

# How to install

1. Download the code. Click on the green "Code" button, and then you have two options:
   - If you're using Git, copy the address of the repo from Github, open a command line interface, type in `git clone `, and then paste in the repo address.
   - If you'd rather not do that, you can click "Download ZIP" to download the code. Once you've done that, open and extract the ZIP file.

2. Go to your browser's "Extensions" settings. This will vary depending on which browser you're using. Once you're there, if you see a toggle for "Developer Mode", turn it ON.

3. You should see "Load Unpacked" once you turn on developer mode. click this, find linkedinNewsBlocker, and then select it (you may have to dig in by an extra folder if you downloaded the ZIP file).

4. You now have the LinkedIn News Blocker! It works like any extension on a browser - it can be enabled or disabled, as well as uninstalled and reinstalled.
