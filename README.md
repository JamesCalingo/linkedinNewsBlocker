# LinkedIn News Blocker
A browser extension that hides the LinkedIn News feed on the main page.

# How to install

1. Download the code. Click on the green "Code" button, and then you have two options:
   - If you're using Git, copy the address of the repo from Github, open a command line interface, type in `git clone `, and then paste in the repo address.
   - If you'd rather not do that, you can click "Download ZIP" to download the code. Once you've done that, open and extract the ZIP file.

2. Go to your browser's "Extensions" settings. This will vary depending on which browser you're using. Once you're there, if you see a toggle for "Developer Mode", turn it ON.

3. You should see "Load Unpacked" once you turn on developer mode. click this, find linkedinNewsBlocker, and then select it (you may have to dig in by an extra folder if you downloaded the ZIP file).

4. You now have the LinkedIn News Blocker! It works like any extension on a browser - it can be enabled or disabled, as well as uninstalled and reinstalled.

# Issues

Currently, the news blocker only works on a "fresh load" of your main LinkedIn feed. Navigating to another page and then returning to the main feed will cause the news to appear again. The way around this is to reload your News Feed if this happens, but I'm hoping to work on a way to make it just work.
